/**
 An enumeration to hold a more detailed description of an error when an API call fails.

 - ConnectionError: There were network connectivity errors. The Network or Server may be down, or
                    responding with a bad status code. The NSError returned with this will contain
                    additional details.
 - ServerNotReady:  The server returned a 202 HTTP Status code, indicating that it has accepted our
                    request, but has not yet processed it, and we should retry later. This happens
                    very frequently with User Collection requests.
 - ApiError:        The API returned an error of some sort. Details are available in the description.
 - XmlError:        There was an error parsing the XML response. This can indicate that the data models
                    are incorrect, or possibly that the XMLAPI has changed.
